    <h2>What is Self Care?</h2>
    <h3>Self care is anything you do to take care of yourself so you can stay physically, mentally, and emotionally well!</h3>
    <p>A few years ago I was looking for ways to practice mindfulness in a more efficient way to prevent burn out from full-time school assignments while working and taking on an internship. Learning about self-care has allowed me to manage and learn about myself better, not only in a physical sense but in other realms too, such as mentally and emotionally. You can explore the various forms of self-care in the chart located below:</p>

        Self-care can look different for everyone depending on what their needs are. It is an action that uplifts people and allows them to find comfort or promote a healthy amount of growth and balance through the care of oneself. These actions can be physically, mentally, spiritually, and/or emotionally oriented. An example of these actions could be as simple as taking more time to lotion your body or as challenging as being more intentional in the tasks we set out to do for the day, or even just setting boundaries with others.

        <h3>The More You Know:</h3>
        <p>I wish I understood why some think self-care is synonymous with being selfish. I also wonder if there are any direct statistics to scientifically prove/explore the direct effects of self-care once implemented into someone’s routine with intention vs. someone who may not actively choose to consciously engage in actions related to self-care.</p>
